CONDITIONS OF USE
These Terms of Service ("Terms") contain the rules that must be mutually observed by users of our app, websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, buttons, widgets, advertisements, commerce services and other covered services (collectively, the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

Welcome to Perks!
Perks is a social media platform where users can express their opinions in a positive environment, rate other users, and interact (including physically meeting through location sharing) with users with common characteristics.

Your use of Perks is subject to these Terms of Use. By creating a Perks account or using Perks, you agree to these terms. We agree to provide you with the Perks Service. The Service includes all Perks products, features, applications, services, technology and software that we provide to further the mission of Perks. The Service consists of the following elements:

• Displaying mainstream posts
• Create, delete posts
• Share, delete, create profile photo
• Like, comment and comment on created posts and photos
• User search, review other profiles, create profile information, follow, block users, mute users
• Sending Android notifications, messaging
• As a result of these actions, the user earns points (PerkPoint) based on their interactions with other users:
Using these points, users can anonymously determine the character traits of the person they interact with by spending their PerkPoint. Thus, everyone's profile will contain traits determined by others who know them, and these traits will be visible to other users. As a result of the characteristics declared by the user and the profile evaluations made by other users, the application will show the most similar people to you with the algorithm and people will have the opportunity to meet people similar to them. These people will be able to set a meeting point for each other, open the app at that point, pair their phones via bluetooth and earn more Perk Points.
• Developing a positive, inclusive and safe environment:
We develop and use tools and offer opportunities that help people feel safe at all times and have positive experiences that everyone can enjoy. We also have systems in place that strive to combat abuse, violations of our terms and policies, and harmful and deceptive behavior. To keep our platform secure, we use Google Firebase to protect all the information we hold, including your information.
• Connecting you with brands, products and services you care about:
We use the data we receive from Perks and third-party partners to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we think you will find meaningful. We also strive to make sure you find this content as relevant as all your other experiences on Perks.
• Research and innovation:
We use the information we collect to conduct studies on our service and to collaborate with others on research that will both improve our service and contribute to the well-being of our community.

In-App Privacy
• The privacy settings for the user's date of birth, phone number, email, location, gender, work or education information and whether the user wants to be recommended to other users in the dating system are asked when creating the account. The default settings are private for email, phone number and date of birth, public for other information and yes for the dating system option, unless the user changes them. These privacy options can be changed by the user at any time from within the app. This information can be set in three ways: public, only for followers and only for the user himself/herself (private). The app owner reserves the right to update these options.
• Users who indicate in the in-app dating system that they do not want their profile to be recommended to other users will not be seen by other users. This does not mean that the setting will hide the user and their posts. It is just that in this dating system they will not be recommended to other users and will not be able to receive dating requests.
• The application uses software where only two users can access user messaging, and when the message is seen by the other party, it is encrypted and saved on both parties' devices and then the message is automatically deleted from the Firebase real-time database. Therefore, the application is not responsible for the loss of messages.
• User accounts and passwords are protected by the Google Firebase Authentication system.
• Meet requests and the messages therein are only open to the two users sending and receiving the meet request. These messages are encrypted and sent to the database and are deleted from the database when they are seen by the recipient. Therefore, the app cannot be held responsible for the loss of messages.
• Only the user is authorized to view a user's followers and followers.
• The user's privacy settings are only available to the user. No other user can directly access this information.
• PerkPoints, which are in-app points, are only available to the owner of the points and the person who can redeem them.
• The application keeps all information (name, posts, post comments, post comments, post likes, number of comments, photos, etc.) open to everyone who is a member, except for the user information and privacy settings specified in other articles, and does not promise a privacy option in this regard.
